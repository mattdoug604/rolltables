#Encounter 5: Reward, Revelation
1	New Quest (e.g. the PCs destroyed only the first of many evil masks, but they find a map pointing to the location of the next mask)
2	Betrayal (e.g. an NPC the players were sent to save was actually behind everything, and challenges them to follow him as he escapes to his lair)
3	Bigger Fish (e.g. the boss was defeated in the climax, but she was actually only a lieutenant working for the BBEG)
